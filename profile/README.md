# WARDOGS Cheat

WARDOGS Cheat is a structured Windows runtime control software built to introduce configurable tactical parameters into **WARDOGS**. Designed for x64 systems, this application attaches during active sessions and enables modular feature toggling across combat mechanics, AI engagement logic, mission pacing, and resource management.

The software operates as a detachable runtime layer. It does not alter installation files or permanently modify saved data.

## Operational Context 🎖️

Tactical action environments like WARDOGS rely on dynamic enemy response, limited resources, ballistic calculations, and mission scripting. Replaying full operations to test alternate strategies can be time-intensive.

WARDOGS Cheat provides structured tools to:

* Adjust weapon performance variables
* Tune enemy aggression and awareness
* Stabilize mission resources
* Modify player survivability parameters
* Create controlled sandbox testing scenarios

Every adjustment is reversible and session-bound.

---

## Tactical Control Modules

### 🎯 Ballistics & Weapon Engine

* Damage multiplier adjustment
* Recoil suppression toggle
* Infinite ammunition switch
* Reload delay override
* Accuracy stabilization

These controls allow structured evaluation of weapon builds and recoil profiles.

---

### 🛡 Player Survival Layer

* Infinite health toggle
* Adjustable armor strength
* Regeneration rate slider
* Fall damage reduction
* Environmental damage dampening

Each parameter includes precision sliders for granular calibration.

---

### 👁 AI Engagement System

* Detection radius modification
* Reaction time delay
* Aggression scaling
* Patrol path slowdown
* Target lock dampening

This module enables testing of varied threat intensity profiles.

---

### 📦 Resource & Mission Panel

* Currency override
* Objective trigger bypass
* Mission timer control
* Supply drop frequency adjustment
* Inventory capacity extension

All changes are isolated to the active runtime session.

## Installation & Activation Guide

1. Download the latest release archive
2. Extract to a non-system directory
3. Launch WARDOGS Cheat
4. Start WARDOGS
5. Wait for automatic process detection
6. Enable desired modules

[!IMPORTANT]
Activate advanced mission controls only after loading into an active operation to ensure stable memory alignment.

    D --> E[Inject Tactical Control Layer]
    E --> F[User Selects Features]
    F --> G[Live Integrity Monitoring]
    G --> H[Clean Detach on Exit]
```

The monitoring system validates offsets continuously to prevent instability during mission transitions.

---

## Configuration & Preset System

All feature groups are modular and independently toggleable. Users can:

* Enable weapon controls without altering AI
* Adjust survivability while preserving mission timers
* Modify resource flow independently

Preset examples:

* Tactical Sandbox Mode
* Balanced Combat Mode
* AI Softened Mode
* Resource Stabilization Mode

Preset files are stored locally in readable format for backup and portability.

---

## Stability & Safety Measures

WARDOGS Cheat integrates layered safeguards:

* Version verification before injection
* Memory offset validation
* Automatic rollback if mismatch occurs
* Crash-sensitive detachment logic
* No registry or file modification

[!WARNING]
Game updates may temporarily disable certain advanced modules until compatibility verification is completed.

---

## Example Tactical Scenario

To test stealth-focused engagement:

1. Reduce enemy detection radius moderately
2. Extend reaction delay slightly
3. Keep ammunition limited
4. Disable damage multiplier changes
5. Observe mission pacing and AI adaptation

This allows structured experimentation without removing core tactical pressure.

---

## Performance Profile

During active runtime:

* CPU Usage: < 3%
* RAM Usage: ~60MB
* Disk Activity: Minimal
* Persistent Services: None

The software fully terminates when the game closes and does not auto-start with Windows.

---

## Update Procedure

To update safely:

1. Close both the game and cheat software
2. Remove the old installation directory
3. Extract the updated release
4. Restore preset configurations if necessary

Release notes provide build compatibility details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this permanently modify WARDOGS?

No. All adjustments are runtime-based and reversible.

### Is online connectivity required?

No. The software functions offline.

### Can modules be enabled independently?

Yes. Each feature group operates separately.

### What happens if the game crashes?

The application detects process termination and detaches automatically.

### Are preset files transferable?

Yes. Configuration files can be copied between compatible Windows systems.
